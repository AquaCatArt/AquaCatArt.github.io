        <p>About me - 
          Born in Austin, Texas I shortly moved to Northern Virginia due to my dad getting a new job. I lived in rural Virginia about 30 minutes from the capital and I started getting into video games and technology. After a few years, I moved to Ohio just in time for middle school, and I have grown up here ever since.
          My first PC was something that my dad threw together with old PC parts we had in a closet, and it worked well enough for me to run Star Wars Battlefront, which I had a disk for. The disk drive constantly got stuck in the closed position, so I never bothered clearing it. This PC was what initially got me into IT as I got to mess around with the hardware and software of it since it wasn't exactly worth anything.
          When I started middle school, I gained interest in IT even more when I was in the PLTW class and we got to mess around with coding for robots. I found myself rather good at it and wanted to continue pursuing it. I excelled in both the middle school computer classes that were available, and I have had a great typing speed of 100+ words per minute on average.
          Entering High School, I experimented with the intro class to IT and decided I wanted to pursue it as a career. I started educating myself in my free time with things like PC building, Custom Keyboards, Networking, and Virtual Machines. After High School, I will most likely go to college for two years and go straight into the workforce for my uncle's company working with Microsoft Azure.
